# ðŸª„ Text2Manim

**Text2Manim** is an open-source tool that lets you generate stunning math animations using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) â€” just by describing them in plain English.

> No need to write code.  
> Just describe the animation â†’ Get Manim code â†’ Render your video.


## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To make mathematical animations accessible to everyone â€” educators, students, and creators â€” by allowing them to describe what they want using natural language, and automatically generating the corresponding [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) Python code.


## ðŸ§  Motivation

Manim is a powerful animation engine but has a steep learning curve. Many educators and students donâ€™t have the time to learn its syntax.  
**Text2Manim** removes that barrier by converting natural descriptions into Manim animations, helping users bring abstract ideas to life with ease.


## âœ… Objectives

- Convert plain English descriptions into Manim code
- Render the code into animation previews or downloadable videos
- Provide a simple web interface to view animations
